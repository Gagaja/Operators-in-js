            JavaScript has the following types of operators.
            <br>
            <br> This section describes the operators and contains information about operator precedence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="main-paragraf one-para ">The code consists of:</p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li>key words</li>
            <li>operator</li>
            <li>variables</li>
            <li>data</li>
        </ul>

        
        
        <p class="main-paragraf one-para ">
            The operators show the interaction of data between each other or allow us to manipulate data in some way.</p> <br> <p class="main-paragraf one-para "> At one point the
            operator works with one, two or three different data, for example, <br> -1 in this way we display the negative number
            1 and the operator minus in this case only affects one data.</p>
            <br> <p class="main-paragraf one-para "> In case 2 + 5 we have 2 values ​​that the operator
            connects,  plus always works with 2,<br>   even if we have for example, <br> 2 + 3 + 4 always at one point plus only includes
            the first following value, <br> e.g. 2 + 3 gives 5 and then 5 is added to 4.</p>
            <!--</div>-->
            <!--<div class="section-two ">-->
        <p class="main-paragraf one-para ">There is only one operator who works with 3 data at the same time: it's a ternary operator that will work <br> after we
            finish the loop.</p> <br> <p class="main-paragraf one-para "> For example in the expression 5 + 3 5 and 3 are values, <br> + is an operator that explains how
            they work together in the code.</p> <br> <p class="main-paragraf one-para "> If we write a code that checks whether 2 + 3 is equal to 5 we will do this like
            this: <br> 3 + 2 == 5 In this case, first 3 and 2 are added, and then their value is compared to 5.</p> <br> <p class="main-paragraf one-para "> Operators do not
            need to be executed in this order, there are rules for which this is done <br> and this is called "operator's priority".</p> <br>
            <p class="main-paragraf one-para ">For that you already heard in mathematics, you probably know that the expression value is below <br> 7: 1 + 2 * 3 
            Multiplication has a higher priority than <br> compilation and it is performed first.</p> <br> <p class="main-paragraf one-para "> And here as in mathematics you
            can put brackets to change the priority <br> (1 + 2) * 3 - now the value of the expression will be 9.</p>
